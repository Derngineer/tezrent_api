# Sales Recording - Quick Answer

## When is a Rental Recorded as a Sale?

### âœ… Answer: When Status Changes to `completed`

A rental becomes a sale **automatically** when its status is updated to `completed`. This is the final status in the rental lifecycle when:
- Equipment has been returned
- No disputes exist
- Rental is successfully finished

## What Happens When Status â†’ completed?

1. **Automatic Sale Creation**
   - `RentalSale` record is created via Django signal
   - No manual intervention needed

2. **Financial Calculations**
   - Platform Commission: **10%** of total revenue
   - Seller Payout: **90%** of total revenue
   - All fees included (subtotal + delivery + insurance + late fees + damage fees)

3. **Ready for Processing**
   - Sale appears in admin dashboard
   - Available via `/api/rentals/sales/` endpoint
   - Ready for payout processing

## Example

```
Rental: RENT-2025-001
Total Amount: AED 5,000

Automatic Result:
- RentalSale created
