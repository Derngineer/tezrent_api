from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.conf import settings

send_mail(
    'Test Email',

    fail_silently=False,
)
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Gmail App Password
- Your current password: `fneo xmrd qego epxy`
- This is a Gmail App Password (not your main password) ✅
- Keep this secure and don't share publicly
- Can be regenerated anytime in Google Account settings

### Best Practices
- ✅ Using App Password (not main password)
- ✅ TLS encryption enabled
- ✅ 4-hour timeout for reset links (secure)
- ⚠️ Consider moving credentials to environment variables for production
