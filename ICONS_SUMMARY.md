# Category & Equipment Icons - Quick Summary

## 🎯 Your Questions Answered

### Q1: "Equipment models require icons, but created categories don't have icons?"

**Answer:** Icons are **optional** for both categories and equipment:

#### Categories (Global, No Company):
- ✅ Created by `create_categories.py` **without icons**
- ✅ Icons are optional decoration
- ✅ Can upload icons later via Admin or API
- ✅ Frontend can use `color_code` as fallback
- ❌ **No company profile** - categories belong to no one (shared globally)

#### Equipment Listings (Owned by Company):
- ✅ Equipment images handled separately (max 7 per listing)
- ✅ **Requires company profile** - equipment belongs to specific company
- ✅ Images uploaded via FormData with key name "images"

### Q2: "Which company profile was used for categories?"

**Answer:** **NONE!** Categories don't use company profiles.

- ❌ Categories = Global/shared (like tags)
- ✅ Equipment = Company-specific (requires seller_company)
