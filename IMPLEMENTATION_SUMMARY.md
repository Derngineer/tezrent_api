# Implementation Summary - Document Management & Auto-Approval

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Date: October 28, 2025
### Developer: AI Assistant
### Status: **COMPLETE - Ready for Frontend Integration**

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. Operating Manual Upload for Equipment Listings

**Problem:** 
- Seller had no way to upload operating manuals when creating equipment
- Frontend form missing file upload field

**Solution:**
- Added `operating_manual` FileField to Equipment model (already existed in migrations)
- Added `manual_description` TextField to Equipment model  
- Updated all Equipment serializers to include these fields:
  - `EquipmentDetailSerializer`
  - `EquipmentCreateSerializer`
  - `EquipmentUpdateSerializer`

**Files Modified:**
- `equipment/serializers.py` - Lines 273, 325, 418

**Frontend Requirements:**
- Add file input field for `operating_manual` (accept PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- Add textarea for `manual_description`
- Use FormData to submit with other equipment fields

---

### 2. Payment Receipt Upload for Cash on Delivery

**Problem:**
- Seller had no way to upload payment receipts after collecting cash
- No endpoint or UI for receipt management

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `RentalPayment` model with receipt fields (already existed in migrations):
  - `receipt_file` (FileField) - Photo or PDF of receipt
  - `receipt_number` (CharField) - Receipt/invoice number
  - `notes` (TextField) - Payment notes
- Updated `RentalPaymentSerializer` with receipt fields and URL generation
- Created new API endpoint: `POST /api/rentals/rentals/{id}/upload_payment_receipt/`

**Files Modified:**
- `rentals/serializers.py` - Lines 51-67
- `rentals/views.py` - Lines 234-303 (new endpoint)

**Frontend Requirements:**
- Create receipt upload form in seller dashboard
- Include fields: receipt_file, receipt_number, notes
- Show after cash on delivery payment collected

---

### 3. Auto-Approval for Small Orders (Quantity < 5)

**Problem:**
- All rentals went to "pending" status requiring seller approval
- User wanted small orders (< 5 units) to be auto-approved

**Solution:**
- Modified `RentalCreateSerializer.create()` method
- Added logic: `if quantity < 5: status = 'approved'`
- Rentals with quantity >= 5 still go to "pending" for seller approval
- Status update notes reflect auto-approval reason

**Files Modified:**
- `rentals/serializers.py` - Lines 310-343

**Frontend Impact:**
- Customer sees "✅ Auto-Approved" immediately for small orders
- Can proceed to payment without waiting for seller
- Large orders still show "⏳ Pending Approval"

---

### 4. Auto-Generation of Rental Documents

**Problem:**
- No rental agreements being created automatically
- Operating manuals not attached to rentals
- No visibility control on documents

**Solution:**

**a) Rental Agreement Auto-Generation**
- Created `_create_rental_agreement()` private method
- Generates text file with rental terms when rental is created
- Includes: parties, equipment, dates, pricing, delivery info, T&Cs
- Status: 🔓 Unlocked (visible immediately to customer)

**b) Operating Manual Auto-Attachment**
- Created `_attach_operating_manual()` private method
- If equipment has operating manual, automatically attach to rental
- References equipment's manual file
- Status: 🔒 Locked (requires payment to unlock)

**c) Visibility Controls**
- Enhanced `RentalDocumentSerializer` with:
  - `visible_to_customer` field
  - `requires_payment` field
  - `is_locked` calculated field (checks if payment completed)
- Documents filter based on user type (customer vs seller)

**Files Modified:**
- `rentals/serializers.py` - Lines 345-416 (new methods)
- `rentals/serializers.py` - Lines 69-100 (enhanced serializer)

**Frontend Requirements:**
- Display documents list with lock indicators
- Show "🔒 Unlocks after payment" for locked documents
- Allow download only for unlocked documents

---

### 5. Document Viewing & Management Endpoints

**Problem:**
- No way to view rental documents from API
- No endpoint to upload additional documents

**Solution:**

**a) Get Rental Documents**
- Endpoint: `GET /api/rentals/rentals/{id}/documents/`
- Returns all documents with visibility filtering
- Customer sees only visible_to_customer=True documents
- Seller sees all documents
- Each document has `is_locked` status

**b) Upload Rental Document**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/rentals/rentals/{id}/upload_document/`
- Allows both seller and customer to upload documents
- Supports all 9 document types
- Customizable visibility

**Files Modified:**
- `rentals/views.py` - Lines 305-379 (new endpoints)

**Frontend Requirements:**
- Customer app: Document viewing screen
- Seller app: Document upload interface
- Show lock/unlock indicators on each document

3. **🆕 Adds manual description**
4. Submits form → Equipment created with manual attached

### Customer Books Equipment:
1. Selects equipment, dates, and quantity
2. Submits booking
3. **🆕 If quantity < 5 → Status = "approved" ✅**
4. **🆕 If quantity >= 5 → Status = "pending" ⏳**
5. **🆕 Rental agreement auto-generated (unlocked)**
6. **🆕 Operating manual auto-attached (locked)**

### Customer Views Documents:
1. Opens rental details
2. Sees document list:
   - ✅ Rental Agreement (can download immediately)
   - 🔒 Operating Manual (locked until payment)

### Seller Collects Payment:
1. Meets customer for cash on delivery
2. Collects payment
3. **🆕 Opens receipt upload form**
4. **🆕 Uploads receipt photo/PDF**
5. **🆕 Enters receipt number and notes**
6. Submits → Payment marked as completed

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Models Enhanced:
```python
# Equipment
operating_manual = FileField(upload_to='equipment_manuals/')
manual_description = TextField()

# RentalPayment
receipt_file = FileField(upload_to='payment_receipts/')
receipt_number = CharField(max_length=50)
notes = TextField()

# RentalDocument
visible_to_customer = BooleanField(default=True)
requires_payment = BooleanField(default=False)
# is_locked calculated based on payment status
```

### API Endpoints Added:
```
POST /api/rentals/rentals/{id}/upload_payment_receipt/
GET  /api/rentals/rentals/{id}/documents/
POST /api/rentals/rentals/{id}/upload_document/
```

### Auto-Approval Logic:
```python
if quantity < 5:
    validated_data['status'] = 'approved'
    validated_data['approved_at'] = timezone.now()
else:
    validated_data['status'] = 'pending'
```

### Document Lock Logic:
```python
def get_is_locked(self, obj):
    if not obj.requires_payment:
        return False
    
    completed_payment = obj.rental.payments.filter(
        payment_status='completed'
    ).exists()
    
    return not completed_payment  # Locked if no payment
```
