# TezRent API - Implementation Progress

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Just Now!)

### 1. Notification System - FULLY OPERATIONAL
**Status:** ‚úÖ Installed, Migrated, and Tested

**What was created:**
- ‚úÖ `notifications/models.py` - 3 models (Notification, PushNotificationToken, NotificationPreference)
- ‚úÖ `notifications/services.py` - NotificationService with helper functions
- ‚úÖ `notifications/signals.py` - Auto-create preferences for new users
- ‚úÖ `notifications/admin.py` - Full admin interface
- ‚úÖ Database migrations applied successfully
- ‚úÖ Test notification created and verified

**Available Helper Functions:**
```python
from notifications.services import (
    notify_rental_request,      # Alert seller of new rental
    notify_rental_approved,     # Alert customer of approval
    notify_rental_rejected,     # Alert customer of rejection
    notify_payment_received     # Alert seller of payment
)
```

**Next Steps for Notifications:**
1. ‚è≥ Create API endpoints for notifications (serializers + views)
2. ‚è≥ Integrate into rental workflow (add to views)
3. ‚è≥ Set up Expo Push Notifications for React Native
4. ‚è≥ Configure email backend (currently using console backend)

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### 2. Equipment & Rental Models
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to run migrations

**Issue:** Equipment model has `seller_company` field but hasn't been migrated yet.

**What needs to be done:**
```bash
# Option 1: Fresh start (if no important data)
python manage.py migrate equipment zero
python manage.py migrate rentals zero
rm equipment/migrations/0001_initial.py
rm rentals/migrations/0001_initial.py
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Option 2: If you have data, add default temporarily
# We already discussed this approach
```

def approve(self, request, pk=None):
    rental = self.get_object()
    
    # ... existing approval logic ...
    rental.status = 'approved'
    rental.save()
    
    # ADD THIS LINE:
    notify_rental_approved(rental)
    
    return Response(...)
```

#### D. Add File Validators
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Files to modify:**
- `equipment/models.py` - Add validators to EquipmentImage

    notes = models.TextField(blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    class Meta:

@receiver(post_save, sender=Rental)
def update_equipment_availability(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    equipment = instance.equipment
    
    if instance.status in ['confirmed', 'delivered', 'in_progress']:
        equipment.available_units -= instance.quantity
    elif instance.status in ['completed', 'cancelled']:
        equipment.available_units += instance.quantity

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Today)

### 1. Fix Migrations First
```bash
# Check current migration status
python manage.py showmigrations

# If you have no important data:
python manage.py migrate equipment zero
python manage.py migrate rentals zero
find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete
find . -path "*/migrations/*.pyc" -delete
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# If you have data you want to keep, we need a different approach
```

### 2. Create Notification API (30 minutes)
Create these files:
- `notifications/serializers.py` - Serialize notification data
- `notifications/views.py` - API endpoints
- `notifications/urls.py` - URL routing
- Update `config/urls.py` - Include notification URLs

### 3. Integrate Notifications into Rentals (15 minutes)
Update `rentals/views.py` to call notification functions when:
- Rental is created ‚Üí notify seller
- Rental is approved ‚Üí notify customer
- Rental is rejected ‚Üí notify customer
- Payment is received ‚Üí notify seller
- Status changes ‚Üí notify both parties

### 4. Test the Complete Flow (20 minutes)
1. Create equipment listing (as seller)
2. Create rental request (as customer)
3. Approve rental (as seller)
4. Verify notifications are created
5. Test API endpoints
